        <center>About Us</center>
        <p class="aboutus">Hello everyone, and welcome to the official DHS Table Tennis Club Website! Table Tennis is a highly unpopular sport in the U.S. and our mission is to change that
        because we truly believe that Table Tennis deserves to be recognized. By creating this club, we are giving an opportunity for all DHS students to not only play
        Table Tennis, but to learn the fundamentals and implement their newfound skills in league events against other schools. </p>
